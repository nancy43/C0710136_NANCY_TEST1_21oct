            <p>Red and Slim found the two strange little animals the morning
after they heard the thunder sounds. They knew that they could
never show their new pets to their parents.He sat up stiffly in bed. Seconds passed while he interpreted his
strange surroundings. He wasn't in his own home, of course. This
was out in the country. It was colder than it should be and there
was green at the window.
"Slim!"
The call was a hoarse, urgent whisper, and the youngster
bounded to the open window.
Slim wasn't his real name, but the new friend he had met the day
before had needed only one look at his slight figure to say, "You're
Slim." He added, "I'm Red."
Red wasn't his real name, either, but its appropriateness was
obvious. They were friends instantly with the quick unquestioning
friendship of young ones not yet quite in adolescence, before even
the first stains of adulthood began to make their appearance.
Slim cried, "Hi, Red!" and waved cheerfully, still blinking the
sleep out of himself.
Red kept to his croaking whisper, "Quiet! You want to wake
somebody?"
Slim noticed all at once that the sun scarcely topped the low hills
in the east, that the shadows were long and soft, and that the grass
was wet.
Slim said, more softly, "What's the matter?"
Red only waved for him to come out.
Slim dressed quickly, gladly confining his morning wash to the
momentary sprinkle of a little lukewarm water. He let the air dry
the exposed portions of his body as he ran out, while bare skin
grew wet against the dewy grass.
Red said, "You've got to be quiet. If Mom wakes up or Dad or
your Dad or even any of the hands then it'll be 'Come on in or
you'll catch your death of cold.'"
He mimicked voice and tone faithfully, so that Slim laughed and
thought that there had never been so funny a fellow as Red.
Slim said, eagerly, "Do you come out here every day like this,
Red? Real early? It's like the whole world is just yours, isn't it,
Red? No one else around and all like that." He felt proud at being
allowed entrance into this private world.

            <p>Red stared at him sidelong. He said carelessly, "I've been up for
hours. Didn't you hear it last night?"
"Hear what?"
"Thunder."
"Was there a thunderstorm?" Slim never slept through a
thunderstorm.
"I guess not. But there was thunder. I heard it, and then I went
to the window and it wasn't raining. It was all stars and the sky
was just getting sort of almost gray. You know what I mean?"
Slim had never seen it so, but he nodded.
"So I just thought I'd go out," said Red.
They walked along the grassy side of the concrete road that split
the panorama right down the middle all the way down to where it
vanished among the hills. It was so old that Red's father couldn't
tell Red when it had been built. It didn't have a crack or a rough
spot in it.
Red said, "Can you keep a secret?"
"Sure, Red. What kind of a secret?"
"Just a secret. Maybe I'll tell you and maybe I won't. I don't
know yet." Red broke a long, supple stem from a fern they passed,
methodically stripped it of its leaflets and swung what was left
whip-fashion. For a moment, he was on a wild charger, which
reared and champed under his iron control. Then he got tired,
tossed the whip aside and stowed the charger away in a corner of
his imagination for future use.

            <p>He said, "There'll be a circus around."
Slim said, "That's no secret. I knew that. My Dad told me even
before we came here—"
"That's not the secret. Fine secret! Ever see a circus?"
"Oh, sure. You bet."
"Like it?"
"Say, there isn't anything I like better."
Red was watching out of the corner of his eyes again. "Ever think
you would like to be with a circus? I mean, for good?"
Slim considered, "I guess not. I think I'll be an astronomer like
my Dad. I think he wants me to be."
"Huh! Astronomer!" said Red.
Slim felt the doors of the new, private world closing on him and
astronomy became a thing of dead stars and black, empty space.
He said, placatingly, "A circus would be more fun."
"You're just saying that."
"No, I'm not. I mean it."
Red grew argumentative. "Suppose you had a chance to join the
circus right now. What would you do?"
"I—I—"
"See!" Red affected scornful laughter.
Slim was stung. "I'd join up."</p>
